=  Description:  =
==================

Book.java:
the first class i made.
in this class we cunstructed the book class, 
here we can make a book object that can be added to the library.
The book itself contains few paramethers:
-The name of the book.
- The name of the author.
-The year of publication.
- the dramatic value.
- The comic value.
-The education value.

Patron.java:
The second class, in this class we can construct a patron,
 the patron can be added to the library, he can loan books and returns them.
the parameters for each patron are:
- His first name.
- His last name.
- Comic tendency.
- Drama tendency.
- Education tendency.

those tendencies represent how much the patron values each subject,
if he prefers comic over drama etc.. 

Library.java:
the third and the "main" class. in the library class we can add book and register patrons.
every patron whose registered to the library can loan book that belongs to the library, 
if it is not taken allready,
for creating a library we need to add those paramethers:
- Library book capacity.
- Max borrowed books for every patron.
- Max patron capacity the can register to the library.

exept methods for adding books or register patrons , the library class is also very smart,
the library can suggest books to a patron by his preferences!

==================
=  Design issues:  =
==================


I didnt had many issues with the exercise.
At first i thought that it will be hard to start programming in java but it is no so much diffrent 
from python.
when i design the classes i always kept in mind that the next class need to use the methods in the previous
class.
I used the internet few times for more understanding hows the array works and how to implement a correct
syntax.
