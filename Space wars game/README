=  Description:  =
==================

In this exercise i created a game class for the spacewar class,
i have built the main spaceship class and six specific space ship classes that i will explain bellow:
HUMAN: The human ship controlled by the user, he can shoot, teleport, and active his shield.
BASHER: The basher spaceship always try to bash other spaceships by hit them with his shield on.
AGGRESSIVE: This ship will focus on the nearest ship and will try to attack him until he will fined his next
victim, a ship that closer then the last ship.
RUNNER: That ship will try to run away form other ships, if a the runner will feel threatened, 
meaning there will be a ship that are to close to him, the runner will teleport to a new random place.
DRUNKARD: The pilot of that ship drank to much last night, he doesnt no where he goes,
so he will turn randomlly, accelerate randomly and there is a chance of 1 out of 15 that he will teleport.
also he will shoot if he will see a ship that is to close to him.
SPECIAL: the special ship is a very dangerous ship, he will move in circles and will fire to every direction.
his shoots doesnt cost any energy and he has less cooldown between two shots.
Also he has 1 of 12 chance to teleport.
 

==================
=  Design issues:  =
==================

First of all i want to mention that the exercise was a really good one, before i started i spend few 
hours again to watch the class lectures to understand exactlly what i need to do.
The soffest part in my studies is the actual program and while programming  and ofcourse,
it wasnt easy but finally i have learned a lot about designing and im sure that in  the next 
exercise i will have a good idea how to start and how to choose the best way to program the exercise.

So to start i thought about how i gonna realize all the spaceship classes without duplicate code 
and without complications that can execute errors that will be hard for me to find.
I decided first that i will write the main methods that belongs to all the spaceships
in the spaceship main class, in that way i had a good idea how to proceed.
It was in mind to make the code simple,
as for example in the spaceship class i returned the enemy images and only
in the human spaceship class i overide that function and returned the human spaceship image,
so in every other class i didnt had to touch that method and in that way i made it more simple.
Also i wanted to make another class for every enemy ship but ant the end i decided
not to do so for making the program more simple and not "heavy", i didnt want to confuse myself.
Another thing that i though of is that at the beggining i wanted to write a doaction method
for every specific spaceship but after more thinking i figure that it will be better for me to write
the main operation that every ship does per round in the maindoaction method and for every 
specific ship i made a sub doAction method that represents the specific behavior
of that ship, turns out that it is working and in that way the code is more organized.
The design make it is easy to change the attributes of every ship,
and also to change function in the spaceship class.
Also the relationship between ships take place only in the higher classes like
in the spacewars class so the is high modularity for this program.


in conclusion i think the exercise was really good, atleast for me, and i have learned a lot from it.
